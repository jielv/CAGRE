# GRE
Genomic region enrichment 

# Overview
Identifying signatures of a group of genes or transcripts associated with certein development and disease process on a genome-wide scale is of great biological interests. Thanks to the fast development of next-generation sequencing assays, we have a ever-increasing list of  large-scale biological signature reference databases, in the format of a set of genomic regions (e.g., TF binding sites, DNA or histone modification positions, etc.). Here, we present the Genomic Region Enrichment(GRE) tool, a simple, flexible commandline tool that provides biologist the ability to perferm comparative analyses with signatures of their lists of gene/transcript.
